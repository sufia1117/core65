# Core65
Core65 is a virtual 6502 processor written in TypeScript and running on Node.js. It can do much of what a traditional 6502 processor can do such as controlling clock pulses, managing memory, and supports an assembly language similar to that of the traditional 6502 microprocessor. This was a project from a computer architecture class.
